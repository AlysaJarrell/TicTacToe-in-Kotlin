# Overview

This program was written to help my understanding of the Kotlin programming language. 
It is a simple game of Tic Tac Toe where each player selects the row and column that they
want to place their next marker and it displays the board. When someone gets three in 
a row, they are declared as the winner. If no one 'wins' then it is considered a draw or tie.

In writing a version of Tic Tac Toe I was able to put to use my new found skills and actually test if I knew what things did what. It allowed me to continue my reasearch when I got stuck. Tic Tac Toe has many uses of variables, both mutable and immutable, for loops, while loops, lists/arrays 'if' statements, functions and is all wrapped up in a class.

# Future Work

- Fix the board.  Not sure if it was the compiler I was using or the code itself, but it would look fine to start with, but as you played the alignment would get off, sometimes it fixed itself as you kept playing. Other times it wouldn't. This definitely makes the game harder to play.
- I would like to be able to run kotlin on my computer itself. I'm not sure if I was missing an extension or a Kotlin package, but Visual Studio Code showed that I had errors on almost every line even though it would run through a compiler just fine.
- Eventually I would also like to make an app that you can play Tic Tac Toe on instead of having to run it in terminal. I could make the adjustment of not needing to type which row or column you wanted to place your marker and instead you just tap the screen.
